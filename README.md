# Diary

My son just turned 9. He has some interest in computers and computer games (the way it should be) and we talked about whether it would be a good idea to learn programming. This is a diary that I am maintaining about this experiment. Maybe it would be useful to others in similar situation.

## Day 0: Aug 9, 2014

We had already reinstalled Linux/Ubuntu on an old laptop that worked really well for this purpose.
I explained to him the basics of that laptop which he seemed to understand. Though I am a programmer myself, I was not sure if I could teach him about programming, so I started to look for books. Luckily, we found "Hello World! Second Edition: Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners" (II edition) written by __Warren Sande__ and __Carter Sande__. Warren-and-Carter is a Father-and-Son pair! (And Warren's wife and Carter's mom Patricia is a big reason why they wrote the book). So, we started following along this book.

1. Installed Python and Idle (Python Shell).
2. Installed the gtypist program. This is something that is usually missed by people while they teach programming to kids. The right way to type (or touch-type) is so important with either QWERTY or DVORAK keyboards! So, we did 'sudo apt-get install gtypist' (Thanks Linux/Ubuntu) and decided that we will both use the 'Home-Row technique' to learn to touch-type.
3. We decided to follow along the book and do programming exercises from the book.
4. He agreed to Python rather grudgingly for he wanted to start with iPhone programming. But that's the next thing and he agreed to do that.
5. We gave May 2015 as the date by which we'll finish the book.
6. We read up to "Starting Python with IDLE" on the first day. Then he was hungry :-). So, we stopped.

## Day 1: Aug 14, 2014
1. Started reading from "Starting Python with IDLE". He is using IDLE to play with the commands in the book.
2. He is also interested in trying out his own commands. He is having fun.
3. He tried division 10/2. Then i asked him to try 11/2 and 11.0 / 2. He finds the results funny :)
4. He wrote his first program in Python and ran it. Was very happy. 
5. We stopped at "If something goes wrong".
