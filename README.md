# Diary

My son just turned 9. He has some interest in computers and computer games (the way it should be) and we talked about whether it would be a good idea to learn programming. This is a diary that I am maintaining about this experiment. Maybe it would be useful to others in similar situation.

## Day 0: Aug 9, 2014

We had already reinstalled Linux/Ubuntu on an old laptop that worked really well for this purpose.
I explained to him the basics of that laptop which he seemed to understand. Though I am a programmer myself, I was not sure if I could teach him about programming, so I started to look for books. Luckily, we found "Hello World! Second Edition: Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners" (II edition) written by __Warren Sande__ and __Carter Sande__. Warren-and-Carter is a Father-and-Son pair! (And Warren's wife and Carter's mom Patricia is a big reason why they wrote the book). So, we started following along this book.

1. Installed Python and Idle (Python Shell).
2. Installed the gtypist program. This is something that is usually missed by people while they teach programming to kids. The right way to type (or touch-type) is so important with either QWERTY or DVORAK keyboards! So, we did 'sudo apt-get install gtypist' (Thanks Linux/Ubuntu) and decided that we will both use the 'Home-Row technique' to learn to touch-type.
3. We decided to follow along the book and do programming exercises from the book.
4. He agreed to Python rather grudgingly for he wanted to start with iPhone programming. But that's the next thing and he agreed to do that.
5. We gave May 2015 as the date by which we'll finish the book.
6. We read up to "Starting Python with IDLE" on the first day. Then he was hungry :-). So, we stopped.

## Day 1: Aug 14, 2014
1. Started reading from "Starting Python with IDLE". He is using IDLE to play with the commands in the book.
2. He is also interested in trying out his own commands. He is having fun.
3. He tried division 10/2. Then i asked him to try 11/2 and 11.0 / 2. He finds the results funny :)
4. He wrote his first program in Python and ran it. Was very happy. 
5. We stopped at "If something goes wrong".

## Day 10: September 9, 2014

We decided that he'd do computers and Python on Tuesdays (during the weekdays). I, as a parent, (almost) hate homework (but that's a topic for the other day) and he unfortunately has to complete it, that's why we decided on Tuesday.

He's zoomed past the initial chapters and is now doing basic loops. I think he gets the idea. One problem he faced was with this simple program that I asked him to write:

> Write a program to print the digits of a given number, one by one, starting with the unit place.

I think he was trying hard to 'extract' the digits from the number and finally understood how to do it, but there again, I realized how abstract the concept of 'place-value system' really is. Most of the kids (and perhaps adults) do not get that idea however 'taken for granted' it is.

The other program he stumbled with was:

> Write a program to convert the given decimal number into its binary representation.

The reason again, was the lack of understanding of the place-value system.

I think I should cover these things in an introductory programming book. Although I understand that children are ebullient by nature and have (very) short attention spans, we need to be able to explain to them that hard problems are just hard and that we may sometimes take hours, days, weeks ... to solve them in a way that we understand the problem solving process. I need to develop some technical literary skills (remembering late Richard Stevens!) to explain lucidly difficult-at-first concepts to young minds. A balance is needed. But this book is going through the syntactical part of the programming language and working well on making the child learn the 'programming ecosystem', leaving the algorithmic joy aside. Perhaps there's a room for improvement ...

OK, the current status is he's eager to get to the chapter 10 of the book. I give it to the authors that their style rather feeds and enhances my son's curiosity.
